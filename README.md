## 📦 Installation

> ⚠️ **This addon assumes you already have a working OwlGaming server.**  
> I do **NOT provide support** for setting up OwlGaming itself.

1. Make sure your OwlGaming server is running properly.
2. Copy the `scoreboard` folder into your server’s `resources/` directory.
3. Add the resource to your `mtaserver.conf`:

   ```xml
   <resource src="scoreboard" startup="1" />
   ```

4. Restart your MTA server.

The scoreboard will now be active and accessible with the default key (Tab).
